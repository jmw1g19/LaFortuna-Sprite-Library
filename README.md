# LaFortuna Sprite Library v0.3
A sprite library for writing games for the LaFortuna, a microprocessor board running the AT90USB1286.

## Uses
This library is intended for those who want to create their own games. This library lets users create sprites, move them, and detect if two sprites are colliding.

## Example Use Code
Will be updated with v0.6, as the API has changed to accomoate palette support.
