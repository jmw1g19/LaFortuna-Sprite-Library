# LaFortuna Sprite Library
A sprite library for writing games for the LaFortuna, a microprocessor board running the AT90USB1286.

## Uses
This library is intended for those who want to create their own games. This library lets users create sprites, move them, and detect if two sprites are colliding.

**This is still a work in progress.**
